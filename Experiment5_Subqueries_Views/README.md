# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query to Identify customers whose city is different from the city of the customer with the highest ID

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customer
WHERE city <> (
    SELECT city
    FROM customer
    WHERE id = (
        SELECT MAX(id)
        FROM customer
    )
);

```

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the names and cities of customers who have the same city as customers with IDs 3 and 7

```sql
SELECT name, city
FROM customer
WHERE city IN (
    SELECT city
    FROM customer
    WHERE id IN (3, 7)
);
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by London-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE salesman_id IN (
    SELECT salesman_id
    FROM salesman
    WHERE city = 'London'
);

```

**Output:**

Write a SQL query to Retrieve the medications with dosages equal to the lowest dosage

```sql
select medication_id,medication_name,dosage
from Medications
where dosage=(
    select  MIN(dosage)
    from Medications
);
```

from orders
join salesman
on orders.salesman_id=salesman.salesman_id
where salesman.city ='New York';
```

**Output:**

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT g.student_name, g.grade
FROM Grades g
WHERE g.grade = (
    SELECT MAX(g2.grade)
    FROM Grades g2
    WHERE g2.subject = g.subject
);
